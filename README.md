# 👋 Hi, I’m @BalbjornBran

- 👀 I’m interested in programming, video game development, and exploring creative ideas through code.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced software engineering practices, Unreal Engine 5, and C++.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to videogames, game engines, tools for developers, or any creative tech ideas.  
- 📫 How to reach me: You can message me on GitHub, soon I will post more ways to contact me.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started my coding journey creating mods for games and fell in love with programming through that experience. I also worked as engineer for a very long time and find out that I enjoyed more creating software to manage different stuff in my job than doing the duties I was assigned. So, I left my job to become a full time developer and here I am.
